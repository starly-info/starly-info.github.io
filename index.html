<p>... And it is completely <b>free</b>!</p>

<p>Starly let you subscribe to newsletters. Each newsletter help you <b>learn and
practice</b> a manual. Once subscribed, each user receive daily chunks of the
manual (theory) and some questions or exercises (practice).</p>

<p><b>Motivation</b>: We all love manuals and we all know the truth behind the
acronym RTFM. Hovewer, too often, we are too lazy to read an entire manual back
to cover. We can overcome our lazyness one chunk at a time. Reading theory in
the bathroom, in a queue, before sleeping and each time we have time to read an
email. Questions help us to memorize the knowledge better and ispect a little
deeper something that we could have left behind.</p>

<p>We must remmeber what ancients have always said:</p>
<blockquote class="margin-xs" cite="Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu">
  <i>A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.</i>
</blockquote>

Excerpt from the text <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching"
                         target="_blank">Tao Te Ching</a>.

<p><b>Nota</b>: If you are not a lazy person or if you already read the manual,
not despair! You can join as a <b>deliberate practice</b> exercise. Try to
answer the questions and reading the theory one more time, help you consolidate
your memories. How much do you remeber?</p>
