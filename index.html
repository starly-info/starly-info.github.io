<p>Starly help you read and memorize manuals with zero effort.
There are no ads, no third-party tracking and user information are not
required.</p>

<p>...And it is completely free!</p>

<p>Starly host newsletters. Each newsletter is about a particular manual. Once
a user sing up, he/she receive a portion of the manual and some questions (that
works as a self-test) thought a daily or weekly email (<b>text only, no
HTML</b>).</p>

<p><b>Motivation</b>: We all love manuals and we all know the truth behind RTFM.
Hovewer too often we are too lazy to read an entire manual back to cover. We can
overcome our lazyness one paragraph (or two) at a time.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching"
               target="_blank">Tao Te Ching</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="margin-xs" cite="Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu">
  <i>A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are not a lazy person or if you already read the manual, not despair!
You can join as a deliberate practice exercise. Questions and re-read help you
consolidate your memories. How much do you remeber?</p>
