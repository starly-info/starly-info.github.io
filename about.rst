About The Site
==============

Starly born in order to be psychologically helpful to *digest* very long texts
in little chunk ( < ~5 minutes read).

Subscribers receive periodically an old style text email with only their current
chunk of the document file that they want to read, and nothing else.

Each subscriber is independent and receive content from the beginning of the
document.

The newsletter can be helpful to every users from beginner to advance. There is
always something to learn (...or remember) from a manual.
