Vi IMproved's Help File Newsletter
**********************************

`VIM <http://www.vim.org/>`_'s help file is the main source of knowledge about
VIM and his functionalities. You can access the manual typing `:help` in *NORMAL
MODE*. If you don't know what *NORMAL MODE* is, subscribe and follow along with
your daily email :).

Subscribers receive a daily email with:

* **Theory**: a portion of the help file;
* **Practice**: questions to enhance memorization and improve the learning
  process. *Do you know all the answers?*
* **Help**: answers to questions.

Motivation behind these little pills of Vim knowledge:

* can be helpful to every user from beginner to advanced;
* avoid users from reinventing the wheel, write plugins for functionalities
  already covered;
* help you digest a very long text one bit of a time.
