Vi IMproved's Learning Session
******************************

`VIM <http://www.vim.org/>`_'s help file (`license
<http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/uganda.html>`_) is the main source of
knowledge about VIM and his functionalities. You can access the manual typing
`:help` in *NORMAL MODE*. If you don't know what *NORMAL MODE* is, subscribe and
follow along with your daily email. If you do, you will find useful exercises,
tips and advance knowledge too. **Join end enjoy your FREE contents!**

Subscribers receive a daily email with:

* **Theory**: a portion of the help file;
* **Practice**: questions to enhance memorization and improve the learning
  process. *Do you know all the answers?*
* **Help**: answers to questions.

Motivation behind these little pills of Vim knowledge:

* can be helpful to every user from beginner to advanced;
* avoid users from reinventing the wheel, write plugins for functionalities
  already covered;
* help you digest a very long text one bit of a time.

*Do you have any question? Do you find errors? Do you have ideas on how to
improve the service? Do you know some tricky questions that could be added to
the practice section?*
